For this, we will need to know the depth in u-band and see what luminosity this corresponds to. Then, we can determine the same for the g-band 5 sigma depth so that we can see how much we are missing."

Finally, we take a quasar template, redshift it to z=2.5, normalize it to L1450 (calculated using a redshifted tophat template as described in Shen et al.) and calcute its magnitudes in the SDSS u and g bands.
