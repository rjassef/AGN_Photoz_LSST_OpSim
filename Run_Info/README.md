Run Information
===============

The [run_infos.py](run_infos.py) script and [summaries csv] (all_summaries_2021_02_09.csv) file were taken from the [fbs_1.7 examples](https://github.com/lsst-pst/survey_strategy/tree/master/fbs_1.7) of the LSST Science Project [survey_strategy](https://github.com/lsst-pst/survey_strategy) github repo.

The only thing that we do here is run the script [make_unique_list.py](make_unique_list.py) to create a list of the unique OpSim runs that we should be analyzing. The other runs from FBS 1.5 and 1.6 should no longer be considered as viable.
